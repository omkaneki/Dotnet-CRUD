# Dotnet-CRUD
CRUD operation in Web API using ASP.net core and ADO. Net SQL Server
There is a Database Script file which contains the script to create table which I'm using in the table 
You can use Postman or swagger directly in order to check the API
Also Connection string is not added into the Appsettings.json it is handled as an inline query.
